					<span id="albert">Albert Einstein</span> was a German
					mathematician and physicist who developed the special
					and general thoeries of relativity. In 1921, he won the
					Nobel Prize for physics for his explainaton of the
					<span id="photoelectric">Photoelectric effect</span> .
					In the following decade, he immigrated to the U.S. after
					being targeted by German Nazi Party. <br />
					His work also had an a major impact on the development
					of the atomic energy. In his later years, Einstein
					focused on unified field thoery. With his passion for
					inquiry, Einstein is considered as the most influential
					physicist of the 20th century.

					Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm,
					Württemberg, Germany. Einstein grew up in a secular
					Jewish family. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a
					salesman and engineer who, with his brother, founded
					Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a
					Munich-based company that mass-produced electrical
					equipment. Einstein’s mother, the former Pauline Koch,
					ran the family household. Einstein had one sister, Maja,
					born two years after him. Einstein attended elementary
					school at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. However, he
					felt alienated there and struggled with the
					institution's rigid pedagogical style.

					Einstein always excelled at math and physics from a
					young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of
					his peers. The twelve-year-old Einstein taught himself
					algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer.[24]
					Einstein also independently discovered his own original
					proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12. A family
					tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the
					12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short
					time Einstein had worked through the whole book. He
					thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon
					the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I
					could not follow.His passion for geometry and algebra
					led the twelve-year-old to become convinced that nature
					could be understood as a "mathematical structure".
					Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as
					a 14-year-old he says he had "mastered integral and
					differential calculus"

				<span class="work-head">Theory of special relativity</span>: Einstein showed that physical laws are
				identical for
				all observers, as long as they are not under
				acceleration. However, the speed of light in a vacuum is
				always the same, no matter at what speed the observer is
				travelling. This work led to his realization that space
				and time are linked into what we now call space-time.
				So, an event seen by one observer may also be seen at a
				different time by another observer. <br />
				<br />

				<span class="work-head">Theory of general relativity</span>: This was a reformulation of the law of
				gravity. In
				the 1600s, Newton formulated three laws of motion, among
				them outlining how gravity works between two bodies. The
				force between them depends on how massive each object
				is, and how far apart the objects are. Einstein
				determined that when thinking about space-time, a
				massive object causes a distortion in space-time (like
				putting a heavy ball on a trampoline). Gravity is
				exerted when other objects fall into the "well" created
				by the distortion in space-time, like a marble rolling
				towards the large ball. General relativity passed a
				recent major test in 2019 in an experiment involving a
				supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
				<br />
				<br />

				<span class="work-head">Photoelectric effect</span>:
				Einstein's work in 1905 proposed that light should be
				thought of as a stream of particles (photons) instead of
				just a single wave, as was commonly thought at the time.
				His work helped decipher curious results scientists were
				previously unable to explain.
