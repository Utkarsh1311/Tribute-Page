					<span id="albert">Albert Einstein</span> was a German
					mathematician and physicist who developed the special
					and general thoeries of relativity. In 1921, he won the
					Nobel Prize for physics for his explainaton of the
					<span id="photoelectric">Photoelectric effect</span> .
					In the following decade, he immigrated to the U.S. after
					being targeted by German Nazi Party. <br />
					His work also had an a major impact on the development
					of the atomic energy. In his later years, Einstein
					focused on unified field thoery. With his passion for
					inquiry, Einstein is considered as the most influential
					physicist of the 20th century.

					Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm,
					Württemberg, Germany. Einstein grew up in a secular
					Jewish family. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a
					salesman and engineer who, with his brother, founded
					Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a
					Munich-based company that mass-produced electrical
					equipment. Einstein’s mother, the former Pauline Koch,
					ran the family household. Einstein had one sister, Maja,
					born two years after him. Einstein attended elementary
					school at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. However, he
					felt alienated there and struggled with the
					institution's rigid pedagogical style.

					Einstein always excelled at math and physics from a
					young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of
					his peers. The twelve-year-old Einstein taught himself
					algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer.[24]
					Einstein also independently discovered his own original
					proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12. A family
					tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the
					12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short
					time Einstein had worked through the whole book. He
					thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon
					the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I
					could not follow.His passion for geometry and algebra
					led the twelve-year-old to become convinced that nature
					could be understood as a "mathematical structure".
					Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as
					a 14-year-old he says he had "mastered integral and
					differential calculus"

					In 1901, Albert Einstein received his diploma as a
					teacher of physics and mathematics. Unable to find a
					teaching position, he went to work for the Swiss Patent
					Office. He obtained his doctoral degree in 1905, the
					same year he published four significant papers,
					introducing the concepts of special relativity and the
					photon theory of light. <br>
					Albert Einstein's work in 1905 shook the world of physics. In his explanation of the photoelectric
					effect he introduced the photon theory of light. In his paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving
					Bodies," he introduced the concepts of special relativity.

					Einstein spent the rest of his life and career dealing with the consequences of these concepts, both
					by developing general relativity and by questioning the field of quantum physics on the principle
					that it was "spooky action at a distance."

					In addition, another of his 1905 papers focused on an explanation of Brownian motion, observed when
					particles seem to randomly move when suspended in a liquid or gas. His use of statistical methods
					implicitly assumed that the liquid or gas was composed of smaller particles, and thus provided
					evidence in support of the modern form of atomism. Prior to this, though the concept was sometimes
					useful, most scientists viewed these atoms as merely hypothetical mathematical constructs rather
					than actual physical objects.
